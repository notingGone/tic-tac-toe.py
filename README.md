# tic_tac_toe.py
This is my solution to the tic-tac-toe coding exercise [(challenge description)](https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp/blob/master/04-Milestone%20Project%20-%201/01-Milestone%20Project%201%20-%20Assignment.ipynb) from The Complete Python Bootcamp on Udemy [(Course Repository)](https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp).
I did not use any challenge prompts, and only used Google for specific syntax/logic. I never searched for "tic-tac-toe python" for instance.

Some of my approach is the same or similar to the provided solution. Other parts of my code are very different.

## My foci for this challenge were:

* Do not use provided prompts, hints, solutions or code to complete this challenge
* Implement robust input validation
* Modularity and extensibility of code
* Code readability
* Follow PEP8 guidelines

Reusability of code was not a practical concern with such a specific challenge.
