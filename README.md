# tic_tac_toe.py
In this tic-tac-toe coding exercise from The Complete Python Bootcamp on Udemy.
I did not use any prompts, and only used Google for specific syntax/logic. I never searched for "tic-tac-toe python" for instance.

Some of my approach is the same or similar to the provided solution. Other parts of my code are very different.

## My foci for this challenge were:

* Do not use provided prompts, hints, solutions or code to complete this challenge
* Implement robust input validation
* Modularity and extensibility of code
* Code readability
* Follow PEP8 guidelines

Reusability of code was not a practical concern with such a specific challenge.

**\* Challenge description omitted due to copyright concerns.**
